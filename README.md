# Mhagnet App

The Mhagnet app is crafted for personal use and to check some development aspects that I have not previously encountered. It is comprising four main sections:
The source code provided here are Sample Codes sourced from my Mhagnet App at http://www.mhagnet.com/admin/products, intended solely for demonstration purposes.
The app is still a work in progress and may encounter some issues and this is quite a big personal project and doing only on my available time.


## Sections

1. **Admin (Frontend)**
    - I built it with the latest version of Angular, offering a sleek and modern user experience.
    - https://github.com/christopher-natan/mhagnet/tree/dev/admin
    - I highly implemented here the Event-driven programming

2. **API (Backend Service)**
    - I developed the backend using NodeJS with NestJS framework, ensuring a robust and scalable backend infrastructure.

3. **AI Reporter (AI Service)**
    - This feature allows you to upload PDF documents and extract desired information or answer questions contained within the PDFs, I wrote it using NodeJS with Express and using AI.
    - https://github.com/christopher-natan/mhagnet/tree/dev/ai-reporter
    - Using observables and  event-based
   
3. **Driver App (Mobile Service)**
   - For Driver App I am using Dart-Flutter with GetX state management. I've developed Kitakits app and I will use it as the basis for the Mhagnet driver app,
     with just a few tweaks to make it compatible. Check it on PlayStore https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cmnworks.kitakits
   - https://github.com/christopher-natan/mhagnet/tree/dev/drivers
   - Strictly Event-driven programming approach

## Database

The Mhagnet app utilizes MySQL, elegantly structured through an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for seamless database interactions.
