# Mhagnet App

The Mhagnet app is crafted for personal use and to elevate my skills to a new level. It is comprising four main sections:
The source code provided here are Sample Codes sourced from Mhagnet App at http://www.mhagnet.com/admin/products, intended solely for demonstration purposes.
The app is still a work in progress and may encounter some issues and this is quite a BIG PERSONAL PROJECT.

3. **Driver App (Mobile Service)**
   - For Driver App I am using Dart-Flutter with GetX state management. I've developed Kitakits app and I will use it as the basis for the Mhagnet driver app,
     with just a few tweaks to make it compatible. Check it on Playstore https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cmnworks.kitakits

## Database

The Mhagnet app utilizes MySQL, elegantly structured through an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for seamless database interactions.
